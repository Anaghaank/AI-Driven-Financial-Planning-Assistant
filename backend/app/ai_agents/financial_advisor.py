Your current savings rate is {savings_rate:.1f}%. Financial experts recommend saving at least 20% of your income.

Total Expenses: ${total_expense:.2f}
Net Savings: ${total_income - total_expense:.2f}

Recommendations:
1. {"Great job! Keep up the good savings rate." if savings_rate >= 20 else "Try to increase your savings rate by reducing non-essential expenses."}
2. Track your largest expense categories and look for areas to cut back
3. Set specific financial goals to stay motivated
